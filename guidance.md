# Azure AD B2C Community samples guidance

1. **Sample folder** - Under the policies folder, create a sub folder for your sample (all in lower cases)

1. The sample folder may contain following sub folders:
    - **source-code**, for the source code 
    - **policy**, for the policy files
    - **media**, if your readme file contains screenshots 


3. Under the sample folder add a `readme.md` file with following sections:
    - Title and description
    - **Adding this functionality to your policy**, describe the necessary steps how to add the functionality to an existing policy
    - **Solution artifacts** if your solution has dependencies, such as a Visual Studio solution, describe the components and how to configure and run the VS solution
    - **Tests** how to test the policy 

4. Go to the root folder and update the readme.md file with the new sample you created.
